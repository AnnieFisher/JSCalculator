# JSCalculator

This is a javaScript exercise to practice creating tables and other html elements 
dynamically through .js files with eventListeners.

The calculator is a table with 5 rows and 4 data cells within each row. My calculations 
are done through a switch statement that key on the operational id's. I also have values 
"keepNum" and "last". These two values allow the current numeric values to stay on the 
screen until the next operation is completed. There is functionality for "+/-" and "%".
